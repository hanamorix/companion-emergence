# Release checklist

This project is private/local-first during development. Before sharing a public build or tagged release, do this checklist instead of relying on ad-hoc local state.

## Pre-release verification

Run these commands locally — same shape as CI runs on every PR (`uv`
+ `pnpm` + `cargo`). Audit 2026-05-07 P3-12 ratched these from
`python3 -m pytest` to the actual env CI uses:

- `uv run pytest -q` — Python tests
- `uv run ruff check .` — lint
- `cd app && pnpm test` — frontend Vitest
- `cd app && pnpm build` — frontend tsc + vite production bundle
- `cd app/src-tauri && cargo check` — Rust compile gate
- `cd app/src-tauri && cargo test` — Rust unit tests (currently 0
  but will grow per audit P4-3)
- Confirm the bridge starts locally and writes `bridge.json` with
  owner-only file permissions.
- Smoke-test a complete companion loop:
  - create a session
  - send a chat turn
  - close the session
  - confirm memories ingest
  - run soul review/growth paths that are meant to be active for
    this release
- Review `docs/audits/` and confirm no unresolved P1/P2 findings
  apply to the release candidate.

## Privacy and local-data checks

- Confirm no bearer tokens, local persona data, memory databases, audit logs, or `.env` files are committed.
- Confirm MCP tool invocation logs use the intended privacy mode/redaction behavior.
- Confirm WebSocket authentication uses `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer, <token>` rather than URL query-string tokens.

## Packaging/versioning

- Set the intended version in `pyproject.toml`.
- Add or update `.public-sync/changelog-public.md` before tagging or sharing a build; local `CHANGELOG.md` is substituted at public sync time.
- Review `docs/roadmap.md` and confirm known stubs/incomplete surfaces are documented.
- Build the wheel/sdist only after tests and lint pass.
- **Run `bash scripts/smoke_test_wheel.sh`** — builds the wheel + sdist,
  installs into a fresh `uv venv`, exercises `nell --version` /
  `nell init` / `nell status` against a temp `NELLBRAIN_HOME` to
  confirm the package metadata + entry points are honest. The script
  exits non-zero on the first failure; passing means an outside
  installer can use the wheel without falling back to the source tree.
- Audit P3-12: release automation now exists (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
  When you push a `v*.*.*` tag, or manually dispatch the workflow with
  an existing tag, it checks out that tag, runs the validation job
  first (Python tests + lint + frontend tests + frontend build + cargo
  check), and only then builds bundles. Successful builds publish
  package assets plus `SHA256SUMS-<platform>.txt` checksum assets to a
  GitHub Release via `softprops/action-gh-release`.

## Phase 7 — Companion Emergence.app cross-platform release

The Phase 7 bundled Python runtime ships inside the Tauri .app, so a
release means producing platform-specific bundles for distribution.

### Building locally

- macOS arm64, macOS x86_64, Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64 (via Git
  Bash): from `app/` run `pnpm tauri build`. The `beforeBuildCommand`
  in `tauri.conf.json` invokes `bash build_python_runtime.sh` which
  downloads `python-build-standalone` for the host arch and installs
  the brain wheel into the bundled site-packages. Bundle output:
  `app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/<platform>/`.
- Linux arm64: the build script branches for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
  and the Rust path resolution in `lib.rs` works on it, but the
  `release.yml` CI matrix does NOT include a Linux arm64 runner
  (audit P3-11). Treat Linux arm64 as **source-build-only** for now;
  add a CI arm64 job before advertising it as a target tier.
- Windows x86_64: same command, but the build script must run via
  Git Bash (ships with Git for Windows) — the `find` / `tar` /
  `curl` invocations rely on POSIX tooling.

### Building via CI

`.github/workflows/release.yml` matrices across macOS arm64, Linux
x86_64, and Windows x86_64. Triggered by pushing a `v*.*.*` tag, or
manually dispatching with an existing tag for a retry. Bundles upload
as workflow artifacts (`.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.msi`,
`.exe`, `SHA256SUMS-*.txt`) and attach to the GitHub Release. Each
platform also runs a bundled-CLI smoke (`nell --version`, `nell init`,
`nell status`) against a temp `NELLBRAIN_HOME`, which is the automated
substitute for manual Linux/Windows smoke until real host access exists.
Signing/notarization is NOT in CI — see below.

macOS x86_64 is source-build-only for the alpha: GitHub's Intel macOS
runner stayed queued indefinitely in this private repo. Re-add it to
the matrix once a reliable hosted or self-hosted Intel runner exists.

### Signing — open-source default

This project is open source and ships **without paid signing**. The
default state is:

- **macOS**: ad-hoc signed (`bundle.macOS.signingIdentity = "-"` in
  `tauri.conf.json`). All binaries, including the embedded
  `python-runtime/` tree, get sealed into the .app's signature
  via `codesign --deep`. `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passes.
  Gatekeeper still warns "unidentified developer" on first launch
  because there's no paid Apple Developer ID, but right-click →
  Open works as expected. Users get the steps in `INSTALL.md`.
- **Windows**: unsigned. SmartScreen warns "Windows protected your
  PC"; the user clicks "More info → Run anyway." Documented in
  `INSTALL.md`.
- **Linux**: unsigned. `.deb` and `.AppImage` install without a
  signing dance.

Confirm before any tagged release:

- Run `pnpm tauri build` locally on each target host
- macOS: `codesign --verify --deep --strict "Companion Emergence.app"` exits 0
- macOS: `codesign -dv --verbose=2 "Companion Emergence.app" | grep "Signature=adhoc"`
- All three platforms: launch the bundle from a clean user
  directory and verify a chat turn round-trips with `claude` on PATH

### Optional — paid signing (if/when budget permits)

If you decide to pay for signing later, the manual steps:

**macOS** (Apple Developer ID, ~$99/yr):
1. Get a Developer ID Application certificate via Xcode →
   Preferences → Accounts → Manage Certificates.
2. Replace `signingIdentity = "-"` in `tauri.conf.json` with
   `"Developer ID Application: YOUR NAME (TEAM_ID)"`.
3. Add notarization keys to your keychain (`xcrun notarytool
   store-credentials`).
4. Build: `pnpm tauri build`. Tauri handles signing inline.
5. Notarize the resulting .dmg: `xcrun notarytool submit "Companion Emergence.dmg" --keychain-profile <stored-name> --wait`.
6. Staple: `xcrun stapler staple "Companion Emergence.dmg"`.

**Windows** (OV or EV code-signing cert):
1. Get an OV or EV cert from a CA (DigiCert, Sectigo, etc.).
2. Sign: `signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td
   sha256 /fd sha256 /a "Companion Emergence.msi"`.
3. Verify: `signtool verify /pa "Companion Emergence.msi"`.

**Linux** (.deb / AppImage):
1. .deb signing via dpkg-sig is optional but recommended for
   public repos that want to be added to a third-party APT source.
2. AppImage zsync + GPG signing for delta updates.

### Auto-update

Tauri ships `tauri-plugin-updater` for in-app updates. Not yet
wired — needs an update server (S3 + signed manifest, or a managed
service like updately.app). Defer until the first public release
gets feedback on actual demand.

## v0.0.11-alpha.4 public release validation — 2026-05-13

Final public release state:

- Tag: `v0.0.11-alpha.4`
- Commit: `7115525bf84be5bc4637c8499cddcf3caf7a7421`
- Release run: `25806949385` — success
- Jobs passed: `validate`, `windows-x86_64`, `macos-arm64`, `linux-x86_64`

Local macOS arm64 package check passed before public sync/tagging:

- `uv run ruff check .` — passed
- `uv run pytest -q` — 1972 passed
- `cd app && pnpm test` — 56 passed across 8 files
- `cd app/src-tauri && cargo test` — 28 passed
- `cd app && pnpm tauri build` — produced `.app` + `.dmg`
- `hdiutil verify "Companion Emergence_0.0.11_aarch64.dmg"` — valid checksum
- `codesign --verify --deep --strict "Companion Emergence.app"` — valid ad-hoc signature
- Bundled runtime smoke: `python3 --version` and bundled `nell --help` both pass

Public release assets verified present:

- `Companion.Emergence_0.0.11_aarch64.dmg`
- `Companion.Emergence_0.0.11_amd64.AppImage`
- `Companion.Emergence_0.0.11_amd64.deb`
- `Companion.Emergence_0.0.11_x64-setup.exe`
- `Companion.Emergence_0.0.11_x64_en-US.msi`
- `SHA256SUMS-linux-x86_64.txt`
- `SHA256SUMS-macos-arm64.txt`
- `SHA256SUMS-windows-x86_64.txt`

Privacy verification: public marker scan passed with all checked private markers
reporting `0` matches in the public release state.

Expected/non-blocking findings:

- Gatekeeper rejects the local `.app` because this alpha is ad-hoc signed and not notarized.
- Tauri warns that bundle identifier `com.companion-emergence.app` ends in `.app`; fix before a notarized/stable public release.

## Known incomplete surfaces

- Growth modules that remain incomplete must be called out in release notes.
